The TrainRecogniseKey.py file is an example of a logistic regression that recieves input from the microphone and decides if the spoken word is the same one as the word from the data set.

The implementation is for Python 2.7 using Linux as operating system.

The file named KeyWordData.csv contains the data set that the algorithm will use to train itself.

The TrainRecogniseKey.py file will end only when it successfully recognizes the word: "Deschide"
